description: My two beautiful daugters, Myla (14) and Hailey (1). These kiddos right here are my world, and my future. Everything I do is for the better of my family, I want to have a career that allows me to spend as much time with them. They grow up to quick, right now their age difference is crazy, and at times tough for them. One is with friends all the time and the other, well lets just say the house doesn't stay clean anymore haha. All I can say is, I am proud of being there father and maybe one day they will be proud of me.
