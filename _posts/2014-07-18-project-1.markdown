description: First New Orleans Saints game I attended, in Seattle, Washington. Unfortunately we lost this playoff game, but it was one to remember. Anyone familiar with football, they know of "beastquake" an amazing running touchdown by the Seahawks running back, Marshawn Lynch. This touchdown had the stadium shaking to the point it created a seismic reading of an earthquake. Thus the name "beastquake". Hope for my next Saints game to be in New Orleans.
